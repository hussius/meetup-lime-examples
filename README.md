# meetup-lime-examples

Three notebooks with examples of using LIME on tabular, text and image data, presented at Machine Learning Stockholm 2017-09-27.

There are some dependencies, such as Keras, Scikit-learn, and a few image processing functions. Little effort has been spent on optimizing the models' performance; these are just meant to be illustrative examples.

Since the Glove word embeddings are rather big, they are not included in this repo. You will have to download them yourself from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip if you want to try the text classification example.
